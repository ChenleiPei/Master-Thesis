# Master-Thesis

# Toy Projects

This branch includes in the implementation at the beginning of the Master Thesis to understand the Gaussian Progress and Harmilton Monte Carlo Sampling.

GP.py and GP_highdim.py

are the projects to build the Gaussian Progress Model

HMC.py 

is the single Harmilton Monte Carlo Sampling implementation

GPHMC solving gradient problem.py

is the first combination of Gaussian Progress Harmilton Monte Carlo method.
